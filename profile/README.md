### Project Description

Our main purpose for creating this website is to assist individuals who would like to start gardening but do not know where to begin, as well as those who already have a garden and want to improve its quality and yield. We aim to make the website helpful by providing easy access to helpful information and tips. It does not matter if someone is starting from scratch, already has a garden, is a busy person, or manages cropsâ€”the platform will help them find solutions easily and quickly. 

In addition, our website will cater to diverse gardening needs. From specific tips to tailored information based on location, climate, and more, users will be able to find advice that suits their unique circumstances. Whether they have a small garden or a larger space, the website will offer support regardless of their space, schedule, or lifestyle. By incorporating these features, we hope users can help one another, learn new things about gardening, and make the experience enjoyable and rewarding. 

Our website will be built using Astro and DaisyUI, these frameworks allow for fast, modular development. They are designed to handle repetitive structures, which will allow our website to dynamically display gardening information that a user needs.
